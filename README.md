# AlacrittyBackgroundBlur
A background blur for alacritty on windows 10+

## How it works?

It sets the WCA_ACCENT_POLICY window compositor attribute to ACCENT_ENABLE_BLURBEHIND adding that blur effect.

You will have to change the opacity in alacritty settings to see it.

### You can set the process name to anything else in the file and it will also work as long as its transparent.
